# GRAIL Lab Website

This is the website of our academic research group at UNC Chapel Hill.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. 

Our website borrows the template from a couple of cool websites:
- [Allan Lab](https://www.allanlab.org/)
- [Chandar Lab](https://chandar-lab.github.io/)
